## On-call

Having software engineers on call is a necessary part of running software, however there is not a huge amount of information about how to do organise a rota and compensate people properly for their time. Below is a collection of links I've found useful, which I'll keep updated over time.

## Monzo

Monzo have always been open about how they run on-call for their engineering teams. Below is a good overview as well as a follow up post around how it evolved after 2 years of further scaling:
