## On-call

Having software engineers on call is a necessary part of running a tech company, however there isn't a huge amount of information out there about how to best organise an on-call rota and compensate people properly for their time.

Below is a collection of articles I've found useful that demonstrate "good" ways of doing this:

## Google

From the Site Reliability Engineering book:

[2017: Being On Call](<https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/>)

## Monzo

Monzo have always been open about how they run on-call for their engineering teams. Below is a good overview as well as a follow up post around how it evolved after 2 years of further scaling:
