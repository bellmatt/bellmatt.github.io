Another site redesign! I have a Medium account but end up with a lot of draft posts that I never make public.
So I wanted to make it as easy as possible for me to write more often.

I settled on using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme
hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I can now create new content by creating a markdown file in my [public github repo](https://github.com/bellmatt/bellmatt.github.io) under content/posts, and also run it locally by just running `hugo serve`.
